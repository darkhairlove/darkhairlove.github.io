### Welcome! 
 

My name is Robin Koetsier. This site serves as a personal site for my data and blog posts. (Very much still work in progress)
   
 <p> 
I mostly write about Dutch football.
On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualizations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. 
Besides that, I wrote some shiny apps that you can find under the link to my work stuff.
